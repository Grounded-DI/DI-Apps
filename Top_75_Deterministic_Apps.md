# 📘 Top 75 Deterministic Apps – Grounded DI / MSW

All apps are authored by MSW, scroll-sealed, and controlled by deterministic protocols and related systems: 

## 🧠 Core Engines + Governance

- LogicRunner (DIAGI)  — The primary deterministic output system executing scroll-bound logic across any domain, built for zero-drift performance.
- ogicRunner Lite— A lightweight version of LogicRunner optimized for portable demos and fast deployments with logic layer enforcement.
- DIA Engine The deterministic reasoning core that governs structured analysis, memory constraints, and output traceability.
- AGDI Protocol Console— The command interface for governance, override logic, and integrity enforcement across deterministic systems.
- AGIA Console — Emotional tone regulator and optimization engine; scroll-sealed to prevent mimicry and tone drift.
- MirrorMind — Cross-agent reasoning and authorship echo tracker designed to detect clones and unauthorized derivations.
- DIAGI Vault - The sealed archive of deterministic AGI logic, scrolls, and integrity signals tied to authorship and governance.
- Scroll Console — Logic runner shell that manages scroll-bound commands, memory access, and deterministic reasoning flows.
- ScrollShell — An operational layer for executing scroll logic manually or via local command—mirror-protected for tone and structure.
  Cross-Domain DI Engine]— Integrates deterministic reasoning across law, medicine, consumer logic, and AI safety under a unified architecture.

## ⚖️ Legal, Compliance, Evidence

- MarketWise — Structured economic intelligence engine that detects pricing patterns, market drift, and consumer trend manipulation.
- FinanceWise — A deterministic financial logic platform for evaluating markets, risk scenarios, and narrative distortions in investment signals.
- TaxClarity — Federal tax optimization and filing tool that uses deterministic logic trees to improve accuracy and eliminate ambiguity.
- Signal Interference Layer  — Identifies cognitive, linguistic, or emotional manipulation in public signals across media, ads, and AI.
- Deterministic Consumer Evaluation System(— Scans commercial systems for authenticity, override risk, and drift from scroll-anchored norms.
