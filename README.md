This repository contains a catalog of 75+ deterministic applications authored by MSW, scroll-governed and sealed under AGDI, DIA, and ELOC protocols.

All apps are timestamped prior to GPT-5. This archive is scroll-bound, drift-free, and filed across legal, medical, market, ethics, infrastructure, and AI safety domains.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `Top_75_App_Index.md` â€“ Full list of all deterministic apps
- `Patents.md` â€“ 24 provisional patents filed (Mayâ€“July 2025)
- `Scrolls_Used.md` â€“ Mapping of scroll ranges to apps
